# PowerBI-Countries-by-Population-Analysis
Power BI dashboard project built using the Countries by Population dataset. Includes data extraction, transformation, and visualization to provide insights into population distribution, growth trends, and regionalÂ comparisons.
This project is part of my Business Intelligence training at the Information Technology Institute (ITI).
It focuses on building an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes global population data.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
The dashboard provides valuable insights into:
	â€¢	Population distribution across continents and regions
	â€¢	Top and bottom countries by total population
	â€¢	Yearly growth trends and comparisons
	â€¢	Relationship between area, density, and population size

ðŸ§  Skills & Tools Used
	â€¢	Power Query â€” for data cleaning and transformation
	â€¢	Power BI â€” for designing and visualizing the dashboard
	â€¢	Countries by Population Dataset â€” as the main data source
